    <h1>Beauty & the beast</h1>
    <img src="story 1.jpg" alt="Beauty and the Beast"width="200">
    <p>In a quaint French village, lived a beautiful and intelligent young woman named Belle. Her father, a kind inventor, stumbled upon a mysterious castle while lost in the woods and, upon picking a rose for Belle, was imprisoned by its fearsome Beast. To save her father, Belle offered herself as the Beast's prisoner. Over time, she saw past his monstrous exterior to the kind heart within, and the Beast, in turn, learned to love her gentleness and grace. One day, seeing her father ill in a magic mirror, Belle begged to return home. The Beast, heartbroken, allowed her to leave, but with a magic ring to ensure her return. Back home, Belle's envious sisters convinced her father to keep the ring, but a nightmare of the dying Beast sent her rushing back to the castle. She found him weakened and near death, and confessed her love. Her tears broke the spell, transforming the Beast into a handsome prince, who had been cursed by a witch. Belle and the Prince married, their love having saved them both from a dark fate. </p>
